# Preamble

Before you dive into the workshop, there are a few basic things it may help to understand

{{<                                                               page-break first="true">}}
## About GitHub Actions

### YAML, YAML, and more YAML

GitHub Actions relies heavily on YAML for defining the work to be done.

{{<                                                               page-break >}}

## About Hugo - The generator for this site

GitHub Actions (our CICD) and GitHub Pages (our hosting platorm) don't require you to use any particular language or tool.
But this specific workshop is built on the wonderful, open-source [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and the
[hugo-book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book)

{{<                                                               page-break last="true">}}
