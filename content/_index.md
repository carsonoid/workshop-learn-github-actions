## GitHub Actions Pricing

This workshop **requires** you to use GitHub Actions. This is a service provided by GitHub and as such may or may not have
a cost associated with it depending on your usage

> This workshop we have you make a public repository and contains very short workflows.
> This means that there should be no cost associated with doing this workshop.

As long as you make your repository public then usage of GitHub actions is **free**. But
please reference the [Billing Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)
for information on the cost associated with using Actions in private repositories.

## GitHub Codespaces Pricing

For speed and ease of use, this workshop is built around GitHub Codespaces. Whenever possible, it contain alternate instructions that do not require Codespaces.

> You do not have to use Codespaces in order to use GitHub Actions! This is done in the workshop purely for minimal attendee setup.

Each user gets a limited number of free Codespace hours per month. Be sure to *stop* or *delete* codespaces when you are done so you do not waste usage hours
with an idle codespace. If you do not manually stop, the codespace will timout after a set duration (default 30 minutes) so the maximum wasted time is 1/2 hour if you do not
manually exit a space.
