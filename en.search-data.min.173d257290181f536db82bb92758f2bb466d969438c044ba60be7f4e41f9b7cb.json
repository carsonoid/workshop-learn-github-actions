But, we will be using GitHub Pages to serve the static assets, which will require the repository to be public. Everything else can be left unchecked.

If you do not have one, it is easy and free to sign up\nGitHub Actions Pricing # This workshop requires you to use GitHub Actions. This is a service provided by GitHub and as such may or may not have a cost associated with it depending on your usage\nThis workshop we have you make a public repository and contains very short workflows. This means that there should be no cost associated with doing this workshop. As long as you make your repository public then usage of GitHub actions is free. But please reference the Billing Documentation for information on the cost associated with using GitHub Actions in private repositories.\nGitHub Codespaces Pricing # For speed and ease of use, this workshop is built around GitHub Codespaces. Whenever possible, it contains alternate instructions that do not require Codespaces. This is a service provided by github and comes with limitations and a potential cost\nYou do not have to use Codespaces in order to use GitHub Actions! This is done in the workshop purely for minimal attendee setup.\nFree accounts get 120 hours per month which is much, much less time then is required to complete this workshop.\nEach user gets a limited number of free Codespace hours per month. Be sure to stop or delete codespaces when you are done so you do not waste usage hours with an idle codespace. If you do not manually stop, the codespace will timout after a set duration (default 30 minutes) so the maximum wasted time is 1/2 hour if you do not manually exit a space. See the Billing Documentation for more information on the free tier or added costs.\nBack Next Next "}]
